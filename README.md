This project was made for fun to try out Swift UI and see how it interacts with other layers of the application now that we don't have view controllers. With that in mind, this is by no means the correct way to do things in SwiftUI . In fact it's probably far from that given that this technolgoy is so new. We're all still learning. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in WWDC videos and in the documentation.
